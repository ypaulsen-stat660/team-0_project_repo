/*
Note to learners [which is not part of this example/template]: The example below
illustrates how much work SAS does behind the scenes when a new dataset is
created. By default, SAS datasets are stored on disk as physical files, which
you could view by locating in folders called "libraries," with the default
"Work" library located in a temporary location typically not accessible to the
end user. In addition, SAS dataset files can be optimized in numerous ways,
including encryption, compression, and indexing. This reflects SAS having been
created in the 1960s, when computer resources were extremely limited, and so it
made sense to store even small datasets on disk and load them into memory one
record/row at a time, as needed.

By contrast, most modern languages, like R and Python, store datasets in memory
by default. This has several trade-offs: Since DataFrames in R and Python are in
memory, any of their elements can be accessed simultaneously, making data
transformations fast and flexible, but DataFrames cannot be larger than
available system memory. On the other hand, SAS datasets can be arbitrarily
large, but large datasets often take longer to process since they must be
streamed to memory from disk and then operated on one record at a time.
*/

/*
print the names of all datasets/tables created above by querying the
"dictionary tables" the SAS kernel maintains for the default "Work" library

    select *
    from dictionary.tables
